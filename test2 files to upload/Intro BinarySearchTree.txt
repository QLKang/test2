About Binary Search Tree


In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), sometimes also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:[1]

 1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
 4. There must be no duplicate nodes.

Generally, the information represented by each node is a record rather than a single data element. However, for sequencing purposes, nodes are compared according to their keys rather than any part of their associated records.

The major advantage of binary search trees over other data structures is that the related sorting algorithms and search algorithms such as in-order traversal can be very efficient.
Binary search trees are a fundamental data structure used to construct more abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays.
